Project Description
----------------------
Our team has implemented a social media based app meant to help bring users together to hold each other accountable in accomplishing certain goals in a group environment. Group members are able to post goals for a given time period, as well as progress checks and updates to motivate fellow group members to keep up their end of the bargain. Often, getting started on the path to physical or mental fitness can appear a daunting task, but it is something that becomes much easier with the support of peers. This is why we project our app to be used often for users to connect and exercise together, especially when they can’t meet in person.

For example, groups could be made up of friends that worked out together in high school, but can’t workout in person anymore because they’re thousands of miles away at different colleges. They can still hold each other accountable by posting their daily workout routines and making sure the others are also working out.

In essence, this app helps people find and interact with others who share similar interests. We used a React frontend to communicate with a NodeJs backend, with all of our data stored on the cloud using Google’s Cloud Firestore. Manipulation of the cloud database was done via Firebase Functions.
